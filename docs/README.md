# Project Description

> E-Book store is defined as visiting an app that holds a wide variety of books under specific
categories. This brings us the comfort to sit at any place and purchase any book that we
intend to read. This also saves our valuable time and gives us a wide variety of options to
choose from at one stop. This application also gives an option to customers to shop from
anywhere by giving them a glimpse of a few pages in the book to make it easy for
customers to decide whether to go for the book or not. The main objective of the Online
Book Store is to make books easily accessible to public.
